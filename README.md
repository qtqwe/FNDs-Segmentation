# FNDs-Segmentation
The repository includes the code of implementations for image classification and segmentation. The self-check mechanism is located in the cnn_lstmself_check.py file, which facilitates the generation of the final result. 
The dataset used in this study was entirely self-generated and is proprietary; thus, it is not publicly accessible. A representative subset of the data has been made available in the Zenodo repository (httpsdoi.org10.5281zenodo.13937646) for peer evaluation and reference.
